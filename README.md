# Messengram
Messenger and Instagram combined under a single cross-platform app.

# Why Messengram?
I am a guy that uses a Computer for almost anything (let it be work, entertainment or messaging), so I hate picking up my phone everytime someone sends me a message. Answering Messenger messages was easy (thanks to [Caprine](https://sindresorhus.com/caprine/)), but I was looking for an Instagram solution too.

Long story short, I couldn't find any app to match my needs and that's why I decided to build **Messengram**, a cross platform app that combines Messenger and Instagram inboxes.

If you've related yourself to me, give Messengram a shot. You can download it for: 
[Windows](https://github.com/stavros-melidoniotis/messengram/releases/download/v1.1.0/messengram-win.zip), 
[Linux](https://github.com/stavros-melidoniotis/messengram/releases/download/v1.1.0/messengram_amd64.deb) and 
[MacOS](https://github.com/stavros-melidoniotis/messengram/releases/download/v1.1.0/messengram-arm64.dmg).

# Features
- Side by side views of Messenger and Instagram
- Choose which views you want to see at any time (Messenger, Instagram or both)
- Dark mode

# Wanna experiment?

1. Clone the repo and run `npm install` to download all the required modules. 
2. After any changes made to the code you must test the app by running `npm start`, which will run the app in development mode. 
3. No bugs? Great! Go ahead and build the app by running `npx electron-builder build`. The app will compile into an executable that will run on your OS (for instance, if you build it in Windows it will generate an .exe file). For more electron-builder options refer to [their docs](https://www.electron.build/).
